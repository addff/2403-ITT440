## What is Parallel Programming? 
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously. 
This is in contrast to sequential computing, where calculations are performed one after the other. 
In parallel computing, tasks are broken down into smaller parts that can be executed concurrently, 
either on multiple processors within a single computer or across a network of interconnected computers.
