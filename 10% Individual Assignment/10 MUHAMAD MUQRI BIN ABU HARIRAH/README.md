# Comparison Between C And Python

## Origin of the C language
The C language is a imperative language that is commonly used in Unix systems and is the lingua franca of implanted software development. The C language was developed for the Unix operating system by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan as a systems programming language. From its inception in the early 1970s, it has grown to become one of the most widely used computer languages ever.


## C language heritage
* The C language was obtained from another language which is called **BCPL** (Basic Combined 
  Programming Language).
* Similar to C, BPCL was a block-structured procedural language used for systems programming.
* The C language is now defined as an **ANSI** standard under ISO/IEC 9899.


## Tools in C language
1) Man Pages - Man command in Linux is used to display the user manual of any command that can 
   run  on the terminal by providing a detailed view of the command which includes NAME,     
   SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUES, ERRORS, FILES, VERSIONS, and SEE 
   ALSO. The syntax of Man: '$man [OPTION]... [COMMAND NAME]...'.

2) Editor - The editor that can be used:
  * Vim
  * Nano
  * ee
  * Graphical text editor
  * Online editor

3) Compiler - The two most popular in Linux and Unix operating system:
   * Gcc
   * Clang

## Overview

## What is Python
Python is programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and it was released in 1991. Python is an Open-source, high-level and general-purpose programming language. It is used for: * Web development
     * Software development
     * System scripting

## Why Python
* Python can work different platforms (Windows, Mac or Linux).
* Python has a simple syntax similar to the english language.
* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other     programming language.
* Python programming can be executed as soon as it is written.

## Tools in Python language
Compiler: 
* python3
