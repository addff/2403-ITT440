# Overview 

## FORK()
-	Fork copies the memory and makes an independent process for each concurrent task.
-	The fork( ) system call is used for creating a new process by duplicating the existing process, resulting in two processes running at the same time.
-	If we call fork() twice, it will spawn 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 processes. The formula is 2<sup>n</sup>, whereas n is equal to number of fork() command. Which mean if the amount of fork in the command is 3, resulting the output into 8
-	Involve 2 kind of process which are child process and parent process.
- Child process run concurrently with the process that make the fork() call which is the 
parent process.
