### ITT 440 INDIVIDUAL LABWORKS
# IDE Installation (LAB WORK 7)
<br />

## **Introduction**

  IDE has been believed to be first created in 1991, and that is an IDE by MICROSOFT the Visual Basic (VB). 
What is an IDE? IDE means Integrated Development Environment it is a comprehensive facility that is used for software development. 
IDE combines common developer tools to be all compiled together in a single (GUI) application. Key component of what should qualify an IDE is Source Code Editor, Local Build Automation, and a Debugger.<br /><br />

  * ***Source Code Editor*** is a text editor that assists in writing code in its development process, it often includes many quality-of-life (QOL) for the user as such syntax highlighting, bugs chechking for while code
      is being written.<br /><br />
      
  * ***Local Build Automations*** are utilities that is used to automate simple, repeatable tasks as a part of creating software such as compiling source codes, running automated tests.<br /><br />
  
  * ***Debugger*** an extra program to be able to display graphically display the location of the error in the original code by highlighting.<br /><br />
		
That is the requirement for an iDE. It brings such convenience to modern-day developers as it offers a simple and easy environment to develop their programs. Developers used to edit their code with a plain text editor, invoke the compiler, and edit or debug their programs from the operating system's command line. While that itself is not a hard thing, having to use iDE nowadays definitely helps.

## **Examples Of IDEs**

  Technologies keep on growing and as they grows new softwares will emerge in which they will all be more convenient and efficient than their predecessors.<br /><br /> 
  IDE such as the ***Eclipse*** which is a popular IDE that is used by many. while it also support a lot more programming language variety it is however well-known in the community as the one of the most popular IDE for Java development. It is based on the Eclipse Foundation of Belgium.<br /><br /> 
  
  Next, we have the ***PyCharm*** and its name suggested it is an IDE used for Python programming and it is indeed famous in the programming community as an IDE for Python development. with supports of over 50 plugins it is created by JetBrains of Czech Republic.<br /><br /> 
  
  For the next one we have the ***Visual Studio Code*** which is a source code editor, along the Visual Studio Code there is also ***Visual Studio*** an IDE which is both created by Microsoft and both are known to be universally reliable IDE by many for many programming languages.<br /><br />


## **Which IDE will be used?**

For this individual assignment I will proceed with using the can you guess it? The Visual Studio Code [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com),<br /><br /> 
Why Visual Studio Code specifically? because Visual Studio Code Universally accepted code-editor and is supported by many as shown in the Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey, with 73.71% of the respondents reported that they use the editor [Link](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-most-popular-technologies).<br /><br />

What exactly is the Visual Studio Code? it is a source-code editor that has been created by Microsoft and is compatible with Windows, Linux, macOS, and web browsers. It boasts features such as debugging support, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and integrated version control with Git. Users have the ability to modify the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and can also install extensions to enhance its functionality.

## **Visual Studio Code Installation**

These will be the steps that need to be taken to successfully install the VS Code and the Python plugins.
The steps are :

 1. Visit the Visual Studio Code [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com) website. Below is the Interface.
