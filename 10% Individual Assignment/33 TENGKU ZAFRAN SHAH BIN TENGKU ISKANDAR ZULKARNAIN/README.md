# Socket Programming in C VS Python

## What is Socket Programming ?

### Definition 

Socket programming is a method of establishing a brief connection between two existing nodes to communicate with each other. The two nodes are commonly known as **Client** and **Server**. The way of communicating is usually one node listens on a particular port with assigned IP address, while the other node reachs out to form a brief connection. The connection is commonly made for accessing resources from the other node such as files, songs, videos, or some other services. For more detailed informations about __Client__ and __Server__ are as follows:

`Client` --> 

`Server` --> Server's sole purpose is to do as what its name implies - serve its **Client**.

_The diagram below showing how the `Client-Server` interact to establish connection_ :

* `socket()` --> Creating a new socket.
* `bind()` --> Binding the socket to a specific port and an IP address so that socket can communicate.
* `listen()` --> Waiting for feedback from the other end for incoming connection request.
* `accept()` --> Accepting a connection from client and returning a brand new socket to start communicating.
* `connect()` --> Establishing a connection to a remote and private server.
* `send()` --> Sending data that was requested through the socket created.
* `recv()` --> Receiving data that was sended from the socket.
* `close()` --> Ending the session by closing the socket connection.
