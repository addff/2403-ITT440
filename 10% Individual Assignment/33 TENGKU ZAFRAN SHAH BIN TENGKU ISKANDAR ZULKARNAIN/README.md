# Socket Programming in C VS Python

## What is Socket Programming ?

### Definition 

Socket programming is a method of establishing a brief connection between two existing nodes to communicate with each other. The two nodes are commonly known as **Client** and **Server**. The way of communicating is usually one node listens on a particular port with assigned IP address, while the other node reachs out to form a brief connection. The connection is commonly made for accessing resources from the other node such as files, songs, videos, or some other services. For more detailed informations about __Client__ and __Server__ are as follows:

`Client` --> 

`Server` --> Server's sole purpose is to do as what its name implies - serve its **Client**.
